Problem: Personal Finance Tracker

Description: Many people find it challenging to keep track of their personal finances, including expenses, income, and savings. A personal finance tracker can help users monitor their financial activities, categorize expenses, and analyze their spending habits. The system should:

Allow users to input details of their income and expenses (e.g., amount, category, date, and description).
Categorize expenses and income into predefined categories (e.g., food, transportation, rent, salary, etc.).
Provide a summary of total income, total expenses, and balance.
Display visualizations such as pie charts for expense categories and line charts for income and expenses over time.
Generate a report summarizing the user's financial activities over a specified period.
